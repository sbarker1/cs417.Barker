You traverse your way through a string containing such an expression and push numbers onto the operand stack and operators onto the operator stack.   When you see a right parenthsis character,  pop two numbers off of the operand stack and pop an operator off of the operator stack, do the operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide), and push the result back onto the operand stack.   When you reach the end of the expression string, the number on the top of the operand stack is the result (assuming a correctly formatted expression).\n",
